This repository is meant to document small experiments I do with Google Cloud Workflow


This tool can be used to automatize and schedule certains actions within or outside Google Cloud Plataform environment.

It has a very generous free tier. Check here: https://cloud.google.com/workflows


It can be easily used to consume GCP's own REST API (check doc here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/) which gives this tool a lot of ease of use and potential.
